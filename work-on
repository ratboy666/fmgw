# work-on
#
# My environment is a bit complex laptop (llana), storage (carthoris)
# and build (sasoom). This script is run on llana, and does necessary
# mounting and sharing for virtualbox
#
# See work-off for tearing this down. both /mnt5 (on carthoris) and
# /mnt1 (on sasoom) are dedicated to klara. As is 1TB SSD on sasoom,
# which is dedicated to ZFS testing. This is done via USB 3 passthough
# on sasoom and is passed to carter:
#
#   sudo mount /dev/disk/by-uuid/4756cffe-e4d5-4b0d-9d94-1b3567d12eb3 /mnt
#   for i in `seq 0 7`; do
#     sudo losetup /dev/loop$i /mnt/p$i
#   done
#
# Now, this mounts the SSD, and creates 8 loopback devices (or leave
# as files) which are then mounted as ZFS pool on carter. Note that the
# underlying storage on the SSD is formated as ext4 (disable the journal).
#
# set up work environment:
#
#   llana: this laptop - command and control
#
#   sasoom: build machine
#     /mnt1 - scratch 4TB volume (ntfs)
#     /home/fred/mnt -> carthoris:/ (sshfs share)

#     /mnt5 (4TB btrfs)
